# Magic the Gathering: Puzzle Quest
Magic the Gathering: Puzzle Quest (MTGPQ) is a free-to-play match-3 game at heart like Bejeweled or Candy Crush, but it is overlaid with the rich theme and lore of Magic the Gathering (MTG). You will be collecting cards to build your decks and if you play paper MTG, you will recognise the cards in MTGPQ as the card sets follow that of paper MTG. The game consists of battles against an opposing deck which is controlled by the AI. In each match, you play as a planeswalker who must engage in duels with an opponent, charging your cards with mana to cast out creatures, spells and supports. At the same time, you will gain loyalty points with which to trigger your planeswalker’s abilities. Victory is achieved by reducing the opponent’s life to zero.

Over the course of the game, you will gather different planeswalkers to aid your cause. Planeswalkers can be levelled up to unlock new abilities or better stats. You will also collect cards through the Booster Pack system to build your decks with. The game also has a coalitions feature which allows you to join a coalition to contribute your scores in coalition events to obtain greater rewards. The game is currently only available on Android and iOS.
