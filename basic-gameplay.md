# Magic the Gathering: Puzzle Quest
Magic the Gathering: Puzzle Quest (MTGPQ) is a free-to-play match-3 game at heart like Bejeweled or Candy Crush, but it is overlaid with the rich theme and lore of Magic the Gathering (MTG). You will be collecting cards to build your decks and if you play paper MTG, you will recognise the cards in MTGPQ as the card sets follow that of paper MTG. The game consists of battles against an opposing deck which is controlled by the AI. In each match, you play as a planeswalker who must engage in duels with an opponent, charging your cards with mana through matching gems to summon creatures, cast supports and cast spells. At the same time, you will gain loyalty points with which to trigger your planeswalker’s abilities. Victory is achieved by reducing the opponent’s life to zero.

Over the course of the game, you will gather different planeswalkers to aid your cause. Planeswalkers can be levelled up to unlock new abilities or better stats. You will also collect cards through the Booster Pack system to build your decks with. The game also has a coalitions feature which allows you to join a coalition to contribute your scores in coalition events to obtain greater rewards. The game is currently only available on Android and iOS.

## Game Modes
The game has 2 primary game modes: Story and Events. Story mode is a collection of pre-constructed missions mainly used to familiarise oneself with the game mechanics. It also contains the tutorials introducing the new mechanics of each new set and gives some rewards to help players get their collection started. Events are where the main experience of the game is. There are PvP (playing against other player-constructed decks) and PvE (playing against developer-designed missions) events for one to choose to dabble in for the chance to earn rewards from their progress and/or their final ranking in the event.

## Cards
There are three types of cards in MTGPQ: creatures, spells and supports. The top right of each card displays which type it is and the amount of mana needed to cast the card. The coloured band in the middle indicates which colour the card belongs to. The symbol at the bottom shows which set the card comes from. The colour of the card's symbols and outline reveals the rarity of the card of which there are currently 5: Common (white), Uncommon (blue), Rare (gold), Mythic (orange), and Masterpiece (red). The text area explains the abilities the creature has and any underlined text can be tapped on in-game for an explanation of its meaning. Symbols on a card’s portrait are evergreen abilities which when tapped on will also bring up an explanation window.

Creatures have power and toughness, which respectively indicate their ability to deal and take damage. Spell cards are one-time effects which go to your graveyard after being cast.

Support cards create a special gem on the board which will grant you a certain ability or effect as long as the support stays on the board. The number on the top of the gem is its shield strength which indicates how many times it can be matched before it gets destroyed. The little white arrow indicates which planeswalker the support belongs to.

## Combat Basics
There will be various abilities and game effects which override the basic rules, but the following will explain the general rules of the game. Also, do note that all matches are played against AI and not human opponents. This is regardless whether the event is a PvP or PvE event.

You are eligible to enter combat when you have a planeswalker and a deck of exactly 10 cards saved for that planeswalker. These 10 cards will be duplicated four times to form your library from which you draw cards from during combat. If you need to draw or fetch cards beyond your initial 40 cards, the game will automatically generate another deck of 40 cards in the same manner and add it to the bottom of your library.

The planeswalker’s dashboard shows you the abilities the planeswalker has, the loyalty cost of each ability, and the mana bonuses from each colour. Matching coloured gems equate to gaining mana from the respective colour and mana gained goes to the first card or to subsequent cards if the previous card(s) are already fully charged. Hence if as Koth you match the 3 Red gems you will gain 1 mana per gem matched (3) plus the mana bonus from the colour (+9) for 12 mana. On the other hand, matching 3 Blue gems would only net you 2 mana (3-1 = 2).

Matching 4 gems in a row will clear the row which the 4 gems are aligned on, but you do not gain any mana from the extra destroyed gems. Matching 5 of more gems of the same colour in one group will give you a free turn!

Each coloured gem match you make will also give you 1 loyalty point (barring some edge cases). Matching loyalty gems, the ones with a 5-pronged fork on them, will gain you loyalty points equal to the number of loyalty gems matched. Cascades from your initial match continue to give you mana and loyalty points so matching for maximum gain is paramount. Loyalty points are used for planeswalker abilities and you can see that each planeswalker has 3 abilities with varying effects. These abilities not only contribute to your combat effort but help define the flavour of each planeswalker.
